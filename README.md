# Game of Thrones Craigslist

This is my first project (ever) with Sinatra. The project uses the standard MVC framework with Sinatra (language ruby), ActiveRecord, and Heroku. 

The site is a craigslist by Great Houses from the Game of Thrones series (or ASoIaF series). 

I plan to update the CSS and add more features in the near future.
